# Serphi AI   
**Humanized AI Content Creation Platform**

Serphi AI is a modern, browser-based AI content creation platform designed to help writers, marketers, students, and businesses generate human-like, engaging, SEO-optimized, and plagiarism-free content through an interactive chat interface.

##  Overview

Serphi AI allows users to simply describe what they want to create, and the AI intelligently collects the required details such as content type, topic, writing style, word length, and keywords. Once all inputs are gathered, the system generates high-quality content that feels natural and reader-friendly.

The project is built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, requiring no backend or build tools.
