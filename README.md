# Serphi AI 

**Serphi AI** is a modern AI-powered, humanized content creation platform designed to help writers, marketers, students, and businesses generate natural, engaging, SEO-optimized, and plagiarism-free content through an interactive chat-based interface. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, it features a sleek glassmorphism UI, smooth animations, local chat history storage, customizable writing tone and length, keyword support, and one-click copy functionality. The platform supports multiple content formats such as blogs, articles, emails, social media posts, scripts, and newsletters.
